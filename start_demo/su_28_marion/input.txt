Lord, We Thank You (Manny Lapingcao)
Poetic adaptation of a contemporary Christian song lyrics; Meter: 6.6.8.6.2.2.6

O Lord, we lift our song,
With thanks for all You do.
Your mercy meets us all day long,
Our hearts belong to You.
We praise,
We pray,
We walk this life with You.

Each morning breaks with lightâ€”
A gift that speaks Your grace.
We rise to find You ever near,
Your love in every place.
You care,
You guide,
You hold us in embrace.

For friends and those unknown,
For strangers on the way,
We thank You for the world You've made,
Its beauty and display.
You give,
You bless,
You shape our steps each day.

So now with love we give
Our hearts and voices too;
For every moment we have lived,
O Lord, we turn to You.
We sing,
We bow,
We trust and follow You.
