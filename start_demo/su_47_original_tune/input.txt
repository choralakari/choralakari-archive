Since Jesus + freely + did appear +
To grace a marriage + feast
O Lord we ask Thy presence + here
To be a wedding + Guest
Upon + the bridal + pair look down
Who now have plighted + hands
Their union + with Thy favor + crown
And bless the nuptial + bands
In purest + love these souls unite +
That they with Christian + care
May make domestic + + burdens + light
By taking + mutual + share
And when that solemn + hour shall come
And life's short space be o'er
May they in triumph + reach that home
Where they shall part no more

1 O sing a new song to the Lord:
Sing all the earth to God,
To God sing, bless his name, show still
His saving health abroad.

2 Great honor is before his face,
And majesty divine;
Strength is within his holy place,
And there does beauty shine.

3 O give unto the living Lord,
You men of every tribe,
All glory give unto the Lord
And mighty power ascribe.

4 O give the glory to the Lord
That to his name is due;
Come all into his courts, and bring
An offering with you.

5a In beauty of his holiness,
O do the Lord adore;
Likewise let all the earth throughout
Fear him whom we implore.

5b To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God whom we adore,
Be glory, as it was, and is,
And shall be evermore.
