Let there be peace on earth
and let it begin with me.
Let there be peace on earth
the peace that was meant to be.
With God as our Father
we are family.
Let us walk with each other
In perfect harmony.
Let peace begin with me,
let this be the moment now.
With ev'ry step I take,
let this be my solemn vow:
to take each moment
and live each moment
In peace eternally.
Let there be peace on earth
and let it begin with me.
