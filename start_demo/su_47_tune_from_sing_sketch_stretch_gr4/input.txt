As far as I remember, the lyrics are the following:
Come, let's be singing. Who will begin the song? (Repeat thrice)

This tune is a three-voice musical round.
The textbook 'Sing, Sketch, Stretch' (Grade 4, without the 'Stay Healthy' one) is hard to find nowadays.

1 All your commandments, Father almighty,
bring to your children healing and blessing:
Christians who keep them find here their comfort.

2 Daily instruct us as your disciples:
each of your statutes stands firm forever;
faithful your promise, free your forgiveness.

3 God of all mercy, grant me your guidance;
how can the young ones keep their way holy?
I have found treasure in your instruction.

4 Joy comes to nations knowing your judgments;
keeping them brings us close to your kingdom--
laws that spell freedom, true liberation.

5 My heart is listening for you each morning,
never desert me; speak in the nighttime;
open my eyes, Lord, then lead me onward.

6 Put right my passions by your clear precept,
quell my rebellions, rescue me quickly:
raise and restore me, mighty Redeemer.

7 Savior whose Spirit gave us the Scriptures,
train me to trust them when I am tempted;
unless you helped me, I would go under.

8 Vain are my own ways; yours in the victory.
Wonderful Counselor, you are my wisdom:
your word shall teach me; I will obey you.
