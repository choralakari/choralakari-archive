Jesus + calls us o'er the tumult +
of our life's wild restless + sea
day by day his voice is sounding +
saying + Christian + follow + me
Jesus + calls us from the_ worship +
of the vain world's golden + store
from each idol + that would keep us
saying + Christian + love me more
Long ago + apostles + + heard it
by the Galilean + + + lake
turned from home and work and fam'ly +
leaving + all for his dear sake
In our joys and in our sorrows +
days of work and hours of ease
still he calls in cares and pleasures +
Christian + love me more than these
Jesus + calls us By your mercy +
Savior + may we hear your call
give our hearts to your obedience + +
serve and love you best of all
