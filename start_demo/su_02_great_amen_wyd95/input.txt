My God my King Thy praise I sing
My heart is all Thine own
My highest + powers my choicest + hours
I yield to Thee alone +
My voice awake + thy part to take
My soul the concert + join
Till all around + shall catch the sound
And mix their hymns with mine
But man is weak Thy praise to speak
Your God ye angels + sing
Tis yours to see more near than we
The glories + of our King
His truth and grace fill time and space
As large His honors + be
Till all that live_ their homage + give
And praise my God with me
