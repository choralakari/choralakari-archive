May the mind of Christ my Savior +
live_ in me from day to day
by His love and pow'r controlling + +
all I do and say
May the word of God dwell richly +
in my heart from hour to hour
so that all may see I triumph +
only + through His pow'r
May the peace of God my Father +
rule my life in everything + +
that I may be calm to comfort +
sick and sorrowing + +
May the love of Jesus + fill me
as the_ waters + fill the sea
Him exalting + + self abasing + +
this is victory + +
May I run the race before + me
strong and brave to face the foe
looking + only + unto + Jesus +
as I onward + go
May His beauty + rest upon + me
as I seek the lost to win
and may they forget + the channel +
seeing + only + Him
