Christify (Manuel V. Francisco, SJ)
Revision of a contemporary Christian song lyrics; Meter: 9.9.9.9 (trochaic)

Lord, receive the gifts we gladly bear;
earth’s own bounty, fruit of toil and care.
Take and bless the work our hands have done,
make it holy through Your saving Son.

Sun and moon and wind and rain combine,
all creation gathered in the vine.
Dreams and labors, hopes of humankind,
all we offer now as bread and wine.

By Your Spirit, change these gifts, O Lord,
into Jesus, living bread outpoured.
Blessed and broken, given in His name,
hearts are healed and hungers not the same.

Here we taste the feast that shall not cease,
here our thirst is stilled with heav’nly peace.
Through this banquet, sanctified we live,
love unending, Lord, to You we give.
