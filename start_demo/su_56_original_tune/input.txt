52\. Stella Maris (Manuel V. Francisco, SJ, composer; Silvino Borres Jr., SJ, lyricist)  
Poetic adaptation of a contemporary Marian song lyrics; Meter: 7.6.7.6. with 9.9.9.9 refrain (both trochaic)

When our voyaging is frail,  
Rocked by trouble, shaking,  
May we glimpse you through the gale,  
Morning Star awaking.  

*Refrain:*  
Mary, dwelling in the human heart,  
You the star of heaven’s pathway bright;  
Mary, dwelling in the human heart,  
Never fades your ever-faithful light.  

Though the waves of fear assail,  
Storms of grief unbreaking,  
Darkest night shall never veil  
Hope your light is making. *Refrain*  

Lead us onward, Mother mild,  
Heavenward our yearning,  
Till the realm by love beguiled,  
Crowned as our returning.  *Refrain*

Note: The tune of Nod-Krai's Theme / Columbina's Lullaby also fits this text, but inappropriate for liturgical use due to its popularity from gaming communities.
