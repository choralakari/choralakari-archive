Thank You, God, on high,
For the earth and sky,
For the sun and the moon You have made.
Thank You, Christ, who saves,
For the life that paves,
For the gift of eternity laid.

Thank You, Spirit, near,
For the voice we hear,
For the guidance You softly bestow.
Thank You for Your care,
For the grace we share,
For the paths where Your mercy will go.

Refrain:
Blest Triune God, we thank you,
Blest Triune God, we sing.
We shall ever proclaim
All the praise to Your name,
Endless thanks shall our lips acclaim.

Thank You, Lord, for kin,
For the love within,
For the friends who have journeyed our way.
Thank You for each test,
For the strength and rest,
For the hearts You renew every day. Refrain

Coda:
At the end of our days,
Still our hearts shall upraise,
Giving thanks in unending praise.
