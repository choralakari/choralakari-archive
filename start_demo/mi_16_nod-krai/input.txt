Somnias a Luna (Columbina’s Lullaby)
Singable translation; Meter: 7.6.7.6.9.9.9.9 (trochaic)

Sleep, dear dove, the night descends,
Moonlight softly gleaming,
Dreams of bloom your heart defends,
Stars are bright and streaming.
Daughter of the moon, lie sheltered, safe;
Let no dust defile your wing at night.
Though no arms remain, be sheltered, safe;
Slumber now in dreams the moon makes bright.
