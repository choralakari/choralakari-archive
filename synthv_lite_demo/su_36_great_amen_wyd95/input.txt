Prayer for Generosity (Attributed to St. Ignatius of Loyola)
Poetic adaptation of a prayer; Meter: 4.4.6.4.4.6 (dactylic)

O Lord above,
In boundless love,
Please teach my heart to give;
Not counting cost,
Nor fearing loss,
But serving while I live.

When battle calls,
Though weakness falls,
Still help me stand and fight;
Through wounds and pain,
No thought of gain,
But striving for the right.

Though labor's load
Be rough the road,
Let me not seek for rest;
Nor seek reward,
But serve you, Lord,
And know Your will is best.

So let me be,
In heart and knee,
Obedient to Your call;
To love, to give,
In You to liveâ€”
My God, my all in all.
