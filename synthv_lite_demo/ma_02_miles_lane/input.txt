All lands to God in joyful sounds
Aloft your voices raise
Sing forth the honor of his Name
And glorious make his praise
And glorious make his praise
Say ye to God how terrible
In all thy works art thou
To thee thy foes by thy great pow'r
Shall be constrained to bow
Shall be constrained to bow
Yea all the earth shall worship thee
And unto thee shall sing
To thy great Name shall songs of joy
With loud hosannas ring
With loud hosannas ring
O come behold the works of God
his mighty doings see
in dealing with the sons of men
most wonderful is he
most wonderful is he
He led in safety through the flood
the people of his choice
he turned the sea to solid ground
in him let us rejoice
in him let us rejoice
He rules for ever by his might
His eyes the nations try
Let not the proud rebellious ones
Exalt themselves on high
Exalt themselves on high
