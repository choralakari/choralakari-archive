**Range guide in a voice type of Treble / C High (C'):** ··· ‐ G3 - [C4 ‐ C5] ‐ F5 ‐ ···
Falsetto transition point for Treble / C High (C'): at least around A4 or Bb4

**Note:** Middle C is notated as C4. Use the widely accepted tuning system which is 12-tone equal temperament, associated with its standardized reference note for A4 which is 440Hz.

**Criteria for identifying the person's voice type:**
* average spoken pitch
* gender factor of the voice (formant)

**Short singing voice test for voice classification:**
* Let a singer sing a major scale solmization (Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si-Do) in a key refering the table above.

**Note:** The person who identifies the another person's voice type must have an absolute/perfect pitch. The person who has an absolute/perfect pitch to sing, especially in a choir, is very advantageous. For choral performances, expect that all choristers should have their own absolute/perfect pitch to stay in tune when singing homophonically, or especially, polyphonically, by striving to be accustomed to the widely accepted tuning system and reference pitch. Of course, choristers must know how to read and write sheet music.

**Song transposition method:** using C4 - C5 range basis (other name: Treble's centralized range basis)

**Transposition examples:**
* Example 1:
	* Song's original key and its range: Ab; Eb4 - Eb5 (octave (even-numbered range interval, 12 semitones))
	* Note distribution assumption: normally distributed
	* After transposition: F; C4 - C5
	* Target vocal type to sing: Meane / B-Flat High (Bb), or Bass / B-Flat Low (Bb°)
	* Final transposed key: Eb; Bb3 - Bb4

* Example 2:
	* Song's original key and its range: G; D4 - E5 (major ninth (even-numbered range interval, 14 semitones))
	* Note distribution assumption: negatively skewed
	* After transposition: Eb; Bb3 - C5 (Note: if normally distributed, E; B3 - C#5; but if positively skewed, F; C4 - D5)
	* Target vocal type to sing: Alto-Tenor / G Middle (G)
	* Final transposed key: Bb; F3 - G4

* Example 3:
	* Song's original keys and its range: Bb and B; F3 - Bb4 (eleventh (odd-numbered range interval, 17 semitones))
	* Note distribution assumption: slightly negative skew
	* After transposition: D and Eb; A3 - D5 (Note: if positively skewed slightly, Eb and E; Bb3 - Eb5)
	* Target vocal type to sing: Treble / C High (C'), or Baritone / C Low (C)
	* Final transposed keys: D and Eb; A3 - D5

* Example 4:
	* Song's original key and its range: C; G3 - E5 (major thirteenth (odd-numbered range interval, 21 semitones)) or even wider
	* Note distribution assumption: extremely negative or positive skew, or even normally distributed
	* After transposition: Something is wrong with the melody; needs a decision to be revised.
	* Target vocal type to sing: Tenor / E-flat Middle (Eb)
	* Final transposed key: will be transposed after revising the melody

**Rating system for difficulty based on every song's range interval:**
A (Beginner): less than a minor third - diminished fifth
B (Novice): fifth - minor seventh
C (Intermediate): major seventh - major ninth
D (Advanced): minor tenth - diminished twelfth
E (Expert): twelfth or more
Interval between two rating levels: major third

Transposition modes:
* According to the entire song's melody range and note distribution (only for fixed melodies)
* According to the original singer's voice type

If we do not wish to transpose a song, just select a voice type that centrally fits the entire song's notes to the vocal range guide.
