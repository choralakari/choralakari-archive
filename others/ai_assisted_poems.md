**1\. Mòlìhuā** (茉莉花)  
Singable translation; Meter: 7.7.7.7.7.5.7  
  
Lo, the jasmine, pure and fair,  
Lo, the jasmine, sweet and rare,  
Perfume lingers on the air,  
Dancing on the branches bare.  
Take this bloom for love to share,  
All your heart lays bare.  
Jasmine fair, oh jasmine fair.  
  
Lo, the jasmine—sweet its power!  
Of the blooms in field and bower,  
None can match its scented dower.  
I would wear one for an hour,  
But the keeper guards the flower—  
Chides me from the tower.  
Jasmine flower, oh jasmine flower.  
  
Lo, the jasmine, bathed in light!  
Whiter than the snow in flight,  
Purer than the stars of night.  
Oh, to wear you—what delight!  
Yet I dread the scornful spite,  
Laughter at my plight.  
Jasmine bright, oh jasmine bright.  
  
Lo, the jasmine, queen of spring!  
Fairest bloom of everything,  
None can match the gift you bring.  
I would wear you like a ring,  
But I fear the reckoning—  
Will you fade by spring?  
Jasmine fair, eternal thing.

**2\. Haru ga Kita** (春が来た)  
Singable translation; Meter: 8.5.8.5  
  
*Representative Text 1:*  
  
Spring has come with gentle laughter,  
Where, oh where is she?  
To the hills and fields thereafter,  
Through the land and sea.  
  
Blossoms bloom in glowing wonder,  
Where, oh where are they?  
In the vales and woods out yonder,  
Brightening the day.  
  
Birds arise in song and motion,  
Where, oh where they sing?  
Through the skies and over ocean—  
Everywhere is spring.  
  
*Representative Text 2:*  
  
Spring has come with sunlight glowing,  
Where has springtime been?  
To the hills its warmth is flowing,  
Fields and woods turn green.  
  
Everywhere the buds are waking—  
Where do blossoms rise?  
On the slopes and meadows breaking,  
Bloom beneath the skies.  
  
Now the birds are sweetly singing—  
Where do voices ring?  
Through the trees their notes are winging,  
Songs of early spring.

**3\. Haru no Ogawa** (春の小川)  
Singable translation; Meter: 8.7.8.7.D (trochaic)  
  
Springtime brook is softly flowing,  
Through the fields and past the glade,  
By the banks where flowers growing  
Blush in violet and jade.  
Fragrant scents and colors blending,  
Every petal fresh and new—  
"Bloom and bloom!" the stream is sending  
Whispers sweet as morning dew.  
  
Springtime brook is gently gliding,  
Past the minnows, bright and small,  
Shrimp and fish in clusters hiding,  
Darting through the sunlit sprawl.  
"Come and play!" the brook is calling,  
"Chase the sun from dawn to rest!"  
With its voice so light and falling,  
Leads them on a shining quest.  
  
Springtime brook is softly singing  
Near the children on the green,  
Voices bright with laughter ringing,  
Echoes dancing in between.  
"Raise your song!" it seems to beckon,  
"Sing the world both near and far!"  
And their tones, as if to reckon,  
Join the brook just like a star.

**4\. Oborozukiyo** (朧月夜)  
Singable translation; Meter: 7.6.7.6.D  
  
The rapeseed fields are glowing  
As daylight fades away,  
The distant mountains flowing  
In mist where moonbeams play.  
The spring wind softly blowing  
Across the dark'ning skies,  
Reveals a pale moon showing  
Where fading fragrance lies.  
  
The village lights are gleaming,  
The forest hues grow deep,  
And wanderers go dreaming  
Down paths the rice fields keep.  
The frogs begin their calling,  
The evening temple bell—  
All wrapped in haze are falling  
Beneath night's gentle spell.

**5\. Sōshunfu** (早春賦)  
Singable translation; Meter: 7.6.7.6.D  
  
Though spring is named and nearing,  
The winds are sharp and bare;  
No song of joy I'm hearing  
From birds that haunt the air.  
The warbler in the valley  
Would sing, but stays in fear—  
"The time is wrong," its tally—  
No voice of spring is here.  
  
The ice begins to shatter,  
The reeds push through the ground;  
And yet, despite such chatter,  
The snow still floats around.  
I thought the change was certain,  
But skies remain the same—  
Each day a frozen curtain,  
Each night a winter’s name.  
  
Had none declared spring's coming,  
I might have felt no pain;  
But now my heart is drumming  
With dreams that grow in vain.  
What use is hope's insisting  
When cold and clouds abide?  
What shall I do, resisting  
This longing held inside?

**6\. Hana** (花; First line: 春のうららの　隅田川)  
Singable translation; Meter: 7.5.7.5.D  
  
Boats along the river glide,  
Oars in blossom fall,  
Drifting with the silver tide,  
Cherry petals call.  
Spring has cast her shining veil  
Over wave and tree—  
What can match this radiant tale  
Told so tenderly?  
  
Dew upon the morning’s blush,  
Whispers through the air,  
Cherry branches, in their hush,  
Speak beyond compare.  
Evening bends the willow’s arm,  
Stretching soft and wide,  
Drawing me with gentle charm  
To the water’s side.  
  
Silken colors deck the shore,  
Woven deep and long;  
Rises high the moon once more,  
Wreathed in evening’s song.  
Such a view, so rich, so bright,  
Time itself would keep—  
Moments bathed in gold and light,  
Precious, pure, and deep.

**7\. Koinobori** (鯉幟 / 鯉のぼり; Ryūtarō Hirota (弘田龍太郎), composer; anonymous lyricist)  
Singable translation; Meter: 7.5.7.5.D  
  
Roof-tile waves and clouds arise,  
skies where currents meet,  
citrus-scented morning flies,  
bearing winds so sweet.  
High above the earth they soar,  
bold in painted pride—  
carp that tides of heaven bore,  
dancing far and wide.  
  
Mouths agape as if to draw  
boats into the blue,  
fins that ripple, wide with awe,  
bright with purpose true.  
No frail thing may stir their might,  
steadfast as the shore—  
climbing through the vaulted light,  
higher evermore.  
  
Should they scale the hundred falls,  
dragons they shall turn,  
thundering through tempest’s halls,  
crowned with fire to burn.  
"Boys, aspire as we ascend!"  
rings their silent cry—  
crimson, gold, and blue transcend,  
kites against the sky.

**8\. Katatsumori** (蝸牛 / かたつむり; Ministry of Education (文部省唱歌))  
Singable translation; Meter: 8.5.8.5.8.5  
  
Little snail, your shell is gleaming,  
Where’s your tiny head?  
Are you shy or softly dreaming,  
Snuggled up in bed?  
Show your horns with silver streaming,  
Come and raise your head.  
  
Little snail, your eyes are hiding,  
Where’ve they wandered to?  
Are they through the shadows gliding,  
Waking with the dew?  
Show your horns with grace abiding,  
Let your gaze shine through.

**9\. Momiji** (紅葉 / もみじ; First line: 秋の夕日に　照る山紅葉)  
Singable translation; Meter: 6.7.6.7.6.7.6.5  
  
*Representative Text 1:*  
  
In the glow of evening,  
mountains blazing, burning red,  
crimson leaves and golden  
over pine boughs softly spread.  
Some are pale and fleeting,  
some are deep and richly dyed—  
at the foothills' border,  
patterns gently glide.  
  
In the streamlet winding,  
autumn leaves come drifting down,  
floating close, then parting,  
carried past the mossy crown.  
Crimson, gold, and amber—  
woven bright in tapestry,  
nature’s flowing fabric  
dances on the sea.  
  
*Representative Text 2:*  
  
In the dusk of autumn,  
burnished hills in glory rise.  
Crimson flames have caught them,  
gleaming under fading skies.  
Maples twist and tangle,  
ivy winds among the pine—  
at the mountain’s angle,  
runs a scarlet line.  
  
In the stream below them,  
tumbling leaves begin to glide,  
floating as they know them—  
shapes that part and then collide.  
Red and gold together  
gather on the water’s face—  
there, in shifting weather,  
drifts a woven grace.

**10\. Gōngxǐ Gōngxǐ** (恭喜恭喜)  
Singable translation; Meter: 6.6.6.6 (trochaic), with refrain  
  
Every lane and alley  
rings with celebration;  
every voice is greeting  
friends with exultation.  
Joyful tidings now we offer—  
Peace and plenty, year by year.  
  
Winter now is leaving,  
gone without regretting;  
warmth of spring is coming,  
sun and earth are setting.  
Joyful tidings now we offer—  
Peace and plenty, year by year.  
  
Snow and ice are melting,  
plum trees show their flowers;  
nights of cold and silence  
fade with morning hours.  
Joyful tidings now we offer—  
Peace and plenty, year by year.  
  
Hardships we have weathered,  
trials we’ve outlasted;  
now with hope we waken,  
winter’s gloom is past it.  
Joyful tidings now we offer—  
Peace and plenty, year by year.

**11\. Fujisan** (富士山; First line: あたまを雲の上に出し)  
Singable translation; Meter: 7.5.8.5.D  
  
Lifting high its mighty head  
O’er the clouded skies,  
Mountains lie in hush below it,  
Silent, small, and still.  
Thunder’s voice, though full of dread,  
From beneath it cries;  
Fuji towers far above it—  
Crowned in royal will.  
  
Soaring in the azure blue,  
Clear and calm it stands,  
Snow upon its form like raiment,  
Draped in robes of white.  
Trailing mist like silken hue,  
Drawn with unseen hands,  
Fuji reigns in grand containment—  
Peak of peerless height.

**12\. Tane no Uta** (種のうた; Pikmin 2)  
Singable translation; Meter: 6.5.6.5.6.5.D  
  
Red are flames that guide me,  
bold and free of fear.  
Blue, the waves beside me,  
calm and ever near.  
Yellow stars are rising,  
leaping t'ward the sky,  
Purple strength surprising,  
lifting mountains high.  
White with hidden power,  
still and sharp as snow—  
Many kinds of wonder  
in this world we know.  
  
From the crown, a sprouting,  
green and full of grace;  
leaves begin their shouting,  
life in every place.  
Leaves become a flower,  
folded, sweet, and small,  
then in sudden power,  
blossoms bloom for all.  
See how we are growing,  
bright in form and hue—  
Let each self be showing,  
let each self be true.  
  
Red, the dusk is glowing  
at the edge of day;  
Blue, the ocean flowing,  
singing far away.  
Yellow lights are waking,  
born from midnight deep;  
Purple dawn is breaking,  
rousing us from sleep.  
White, the day is starting,  
clean and full of light—  
Every shade a parting  
gift of nature's might.

**13\. Juvenile Delinquent** (Incipit: Am I a juvenile delinquent? I'm a teenager, I'm young, young at heart in mind.)  
Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 6.6.4.6.6.6.4  
  
Am I a wayward soul,  
one no one dares console—  
still, I am young.  
Drunk on the winds of night,  
chasing the city's light,  
lost in my own delight,  
free and high-strung.  
  
School is a list of rules,  
gray halls and weary fools—  
I slip away.  
Neon and song and beat  
pulse through the restless street,  
where heart and hunger meet—  
I live my way.  
  
Home is a house of hush,  
cold as a wilted brush—  
they do not hear.  
Mother with cards in hand,  
Father who won’t withstand,  
offering cash, not stand—  
no voice draws near.  
  
Classrooms have turned me out,  
drowned me in shame and doubt—  
I learned to fall.  
"Go dig the soil," they sneer,  
"You're wasting time in here!"  
They never once come near  
my silent call.  
  
Yet, underneath this skin  
dreams still remain within—  
grace yet untold.  
Audrey, I see in me,  
Natalie’s warmth runs free—  
all I have yearned to be,  
strong, bright, and bold.  
  
Judge me not by my name,  
“delinquent” carved in shame—  
see past the scar.  
Seek not the mask I wear,  
but all that's hidden there—  
a soul that aches to care,  
and reach a star.

**14\. Vengeance Is Not Ours, It's God's**  
Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 12.12.12.12 (anapestic)  
  
Spare a crumb for the lost—just a whisper of grace,  
For a child in the dust, with no name and no face.  
Though I cannot behold you, I feel every stare,  
And I ask: do you pity, or merely just glare?  
  
I was once full of light, with a laugh and a song,  
In my mother’s embrace, where no sorrow belonged.  
For a time we were warm, though the cold world was near,  
And we dreamed past the hunger, the silence, the fear.  
  
Then it shattered—five knocks like the toll of a bell,  
And she cried, “Hide, my love, in the dark of the cell!”  
But my father stood firm as they broke down the door,  
And they dragged him away—we would see him no more.  
  
Through the miles we were marched, with the thirst in our throats,  
While the victors ate fruits in their bright, gleaming coats.  
Then a voice called our names from the depth of the trees,  
And I found him—hung silent, swaying low in the breeze.  
  
In the grip of my rage, I cried, “Vengeance is mine!”  
As his blood marked the leaves like a sorrowful sign.  
But the world spun to black, and I fell to the ground,  
And my scream was a silence that made not a sound.  
  
I awoke at her side—mother fading and frail,  
As the bells in the distance began their long wail.  
Though the church doors were open, I could not let go,  
So I led her through shadows that trembled with woe.  
  
Then the heavens grew wild, and the cannons all roared,  
And the sky cracked with fire as the battlefield soared.  
And a blast took her legs—and she wept through her pain:  
“Do not seek out revenge; leave it all to the rain.”  
  
Still I raged at the void: “It is mine to repay!”  
But her voice in the dark softly drifted away:  
“Vengeance is not for us—it is not yours to keep…”  
Now I beg you for bread, and I pray not to weep.

**15\. Bad Girl** (Incipit: Hey! Everybody seems to be staring at me. You, you, all of you!)  
Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 8.8.8.8.D (trochaic)  
  
Look at me—the world’s deceiving,  
All its judgments, all its grieving.  
Call me “bad,” a child unruly,  
Wayward, lost, and judged unduly.  
But behind the smoke and daring,  
There’s a soul that’s cracked and wearing.  
Dare you truly see me clearer?  
Dare you face your own cracked mirror?  
  
Cigarettes and liquor burning,  
Every wager, riskless turning.  
Yes, I lie, and cheat for cover—  
Pain is all I can discover.  
Where were you when storms were growing?  
Where was care when truth was showing?  
All your titles, all your power—  
None were there in needful hour.  
  
In your arms I found no haven,  
Nanny kept while you were craven—  
Dancing through your veiled excesses,  
Decked in silk and false caresses.  
You who write my condemnation,  
Built the house of my damnation.  
Left alone, I drifted deeper,  
Darkness growing ever steeper.  
  
Craved a hand—a word forgiving,  
Guidance in this wicked living.  
But your names were linked with scandal,  
Every sin too great to handle.  
Now you say my path is broken?  
Look again—your past has spoken.  
All the sins you try to smother  
Still cry out in me, your daughter.  
  
If there’s hope, then do not tarry.  
Come before I’m forced to bury  
Every dream that’s barely clinging,  
Every song I’ve stopped from singing.  
If you care, then reach and hold me,  
Even now, before you scold me.  
If I’m lost, then walk beside me—  
Show your love before you chide me.

**16\. A Glass of Cold Water** (Incipit: Everybody calls me young, beautiful, wonderful. Am I?)  
Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 8.3.3.6.D  
  
"See me now," I sang with laughter—  
Eyes that shine,  
Youth divine,  
Beauty sought and after.  
"Like a star my face is gleaming!  
Rosy cheeks,  
Velvet peaks,  
Like the dawnlight streaming!"  
  
"Time to go! The night is calling—  
Music bright,  
Dancing light,  
No more shadows falling!"  
Through the halls I sped, elated—  
Perfume sweet,  
Tapping feet,  
In a gown gold-plated.  
  
"Child, are you still there?" a murmur—  
Soft and low,  
Faint and slow,  
Like the hush of summer.  
"Just a glass of water, dearest..."  
"Not tonight!  
Dress in sight—  
Mama, not the clearest!"  
  
On I danced, the lights around me—  
Every guest,  
All impressed,  
None could dare confound me.  
Till at last the silence found me—  
Home was still,  
Cold with chill,  
Where no voice could sound me.  
  
There she lay, her hand still holding  
What I spurned,  
Never turned,  
All my dreams unfolding.  
Just a glass—too small for grieving.  
Too much cost.  
What was lost  
Cannot ask for leaving.  
  
---  
**17\. Agony** (Incipit: Agony isn't just a word. It's not just a noun. It's not just something you check in the dictionary or something you hear about. It involves pain.)  
Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 7.6.7.6.D (trochaic)  
  
Agony is not a word,  
casual or hollow—  
it’s a fire that burns unheard,  
leaves you cold to follow.  
Drains the color from your skin,  
steals the breath you're keeping,  
echoes like a storm within,  
howling, clawing, weeping.  
  
Agony will crush the will,  
shadow every motion,  
speak in silence, soft and still,  
laced with dark devotion.  
Creeping through the cracks of sleep,  
twisting dreams to sorrow,  
teaching you that what you keep  
may be gone tomorrow.  
  
Agony, a voice so sly,  
whispers: “You are broken.  
You are weak, and none know why”—  
bitter words are spoken.  
Shame becomes a second skin,  
sick with self-denial.  
Every loss it draws within,  
feeds upon each trial.  
  
Agony will wear a face,  
smiling, kind, and clever,  
pulling you from time and place,  
mocking your endeavor.  
What began as gentle care  
turns to cold derision.  
Agony is always there,  
laughing with precision.  
  
But I rise, though worn and torn—  
let it fade behind me.  
Though I’ve stumbled, though I’m worn,  
strength is still inside me.  
I will breathe and I will fight,  
braver than I’ve ever—  
agony may dim the light,  
but it cannot sever.

**18\. Be My True Friend** (Incipit: Hey! Are you a good friend? Are you a True Friend? A friend that will never leave me? It is you?)  
Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 11.11.11.11 (amphibrachic)  
  
Are you a true friend who will never let go—  
Not just when you’re lonely or needing me so?  
I’ve waited and trusted and hoped you would see,  
But all that I wanted was someone like me.  
  
They said they’d be back, and I sat there alone.  
An hour passed by, but I stayed like a stone.  
I turned to another—I asked with a plea—  
But “Sorry, we’re busy,” was all said to me.  
  
I smiled through the silence, pretending I’m fine,  
But sorrow was burning through each little sign.  
I ran to the rooftop and cried out the pain,  
The weight lifted slowly, like soft summer rain.  
  
“You’re busy?” I shouted. “Too busy to care!  
Too caught in your dreaming to know I was there!  
I waited, I called you—I needed you near—  
But none of you saw me or wanted me here.”  
  
They asked me to join them, but I could not stay—  
Their words had already pushed kindness away.  
The rooftop still called me—I ran without pride,  
Still longing for someone to stand by my side.  
  
So now I ask you, are you willing to be  
A friend who won’t vanish when sadness finds me?  
If you are not fleeting, then reach out your hand—  
Be more than a promise. Be one who will stand.

**19\. Sa Aking Mga Kabatà**  
Singable translation; Meter: 12.12.12.12 (iambic)  
  
If people truly love the gift their tongue bestows,  
A gift from heav’n that through their being deeply flows,  
Then freedom, though once pawned, shall rise and live again—  
A bird released to soar beyond the reach of men.  
  
For language is the mark that shapes a nation's soul,  
It holds the wealth of dreams and makes the broken whole.  
Its worth is shared by all, the lowly and the grand,  
As rivers shape the hills and carve the singing land.  
  
Who spurns their mother tongue and casts it out with scorn  
Is less than beast, more foul than fish that dies forlorn.  
So let us guard our words as mothers guard the young,  
And tend with love the sacred roots from which they sprung.  
  
Tagalog, like the tongues of Latin, Greek, and old,  
Is noble, rich with thought, and every tone is bold.  
It is a gift divine, bestowed by heav’n’s own hand,  
To dwell within our hearts and rise through all the land.  
  
Our script once flowed with grace, in symbols full of flame,  
But storms of time have swept away its hallowed name.  
Yet still beneath the waves its memory remains—  
A boat once lost that calls us back through songs and chains.

**20\. Teru Teru Bōzu** (てるてる坊主)  
Singable translation; Meter: 6.5.6.5.8.5.8.5  
  
*Representative Text 1:*  
  
Shine, O little figure,  
clear the skies for me.  
Let the morning shimmer  
bright as it can be.  
If the clouds have softly drifted,  
light will fill the day.  
Then a bell of golden laughter  
shall I give away.  
  
Shine, O little figure,  
hear this gentle prayer.  
Make the sunlight linger  
softly in the air.  
If you grant the wish I whisper,  
grant this hope of mine,  
you shall drink a cup of summer,  
honey-gold as wine.  
  
Shine, O little figure,  
bring a sky so wide.  
If you weep with weather,  
tears you cannot hide,  
though you meant no harm or shadow,  
storm and shade must fall—  
then your string I cut in silence,  
quietly and small.  
  
*Representative Text 2:*  
  
Shine, O little figure,  
clear the skies for me.  
Make the morning shimmer,  
bright as it can be.  
If it gleams like dreams remembered  
from a younger day,  
I shall bring a bell of golden  
joy to give away.  
  
Shine, O little figure,  
hear the wish I send.  
Make the weather clearer,  
help the clouds to end.  
If you grant this hope I carry,  
make the dark depart,  
I shall pour you sweet libation,  
full and from the heart.  
  
Shine, O little figure,  
bring tomorrow light.  
But if skies grow grimmer,  
lost to mist and night—  
if the tears of rain keep falling  
though I’ve begged and prayed,  
I shall cut your string, my darling,  
where your smile is made.

**21\. Sakura, Sakura** (桜　桜 / さくら さくら)  
Singable translation; Meter: 3.7.7.7.7.3.5  
  
*Representative Text 1:*  
  
Softly now,  
Cherry blooms across the land,  
Hills and fields on every hand.  
Is it mist or morning cloud—  
Petals drift like gauze unbowed.  
Slow they fall,  
In the hush of day.  
  
Gently back,  
From the flowers’ tender gleam,  
Like awaking from a dream.  
Yoshino with blossoms crowned,  
Tatsuta where leaves turn brown.  
Seasons turn,  
Spinning down the way.  
  
Come with me,  
See the skies of early spring,  
Fragrant winds are wandering.  
Let us walk where blossoms shine,  
Pure as light on distant pine.  
There we’ll pause,  
Bathed in calm and ray.  
  
*Representative Text 2:*  
  
Blooming high,  
Cherry trees in morning light,  
Covering the vale and height.  
Is it haze or drifting cloud?  
Scents arise and drift unbowed.  
Soft they gleam,  
Blushing into day.  
  
We return,  
From the path of petal rain,  
Hearts made still and eyes made plain.  
Yoshino with blossoms fair,  
Tatsuta with autumn air.  
Greens abide,  
Where the pine trees sway.  
  
Let us go,  
Under skies of early spring,  
Where the scents of morning cling.  
Come and see the blooming trees,  
Waving in the gentle breeze.  
Step with me,  
As we greet the day.  
  
*Representative Text 3:*  
  
Cherry bloom,  
Fields and hills in tender white,  
Everywhere a shining sight.  
Is it mist or cloud above?  
Touched with warmth and early love.  
Petals drift,  
Soft as silent snow.  
  
Blossoms bright,  
Seen and left with quiet grace,  
Wanderers now homeward pace.  
Yoshino with blooms so fair,  
Tatsuta with autumn air.  
Green remains,  
Where the pine trees grow.  
  
Come with me,  
Under skies of early spring,  
Breath of dawn is wandering.  
Let us walk where flowers gleam,  
Blushing like a passing dream.  
There we’ll pause,  
In the morning glow.  
  
*Representative Text 4:*  
  
Cherry bloom,  
Hills and plains are softly white,  
Spreading far in morning light.  
Is it cloud or tender mist?  
Fragrant air the sun has kissed.  
See them shine,  
Drifting into day.  
  
Petals fall,  
Wanderers return once more,  
Blossoms seen, then walked before.  
Yoshino in bloom stands bright,  
Tatsuta wears autumn’s light.  
Evergreen  
Stays through every day.  
  
Come with me,  
Under skies of early spring,  
Where the scents of mornings sing.  
Let us walk where flowers gleam,  
Waking dreams in sunlight's beam.  
Let us go,  
Where the blossoms lay.

**22\. The Pains of Growing Up** (Incipit: A child, aged three, in short pants was holding a balloon with his right hand and ice cream cone with his left.)  
Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 8.7.8.7.6.6.6.6.7  
  
*Representative Text 1:*  
  
I ran with joy through sunlit grass,  
balloon in hand, delighting;  
my father's voice would call and pass,  
behind me, gently guiding.  
I laughed, I cried, I played—  
in innocence I stayed.  
But now those days are gone,  
their echoes linger on—  
a child I was, abiding.  
  
He spoke with love, with firm advice:  
“You must be kind, be stronger.  
Don’t strike your sister—think it twice.  
You're not a child much longer.”  
Grown-up, but still unsure—  
what freedoms can endure?  
Too young to rule alone,  
too old to just be known  
as boyhood’s fleeting wand'rer.  
  
I seek to walk this path alone,  
yet feel the ground is shifting.  
The world I knew has overgrown—  
the winds of change are drifting.  
What once came from his hand,  
I now must understand.  
To stumble is my right,  
to learn through loss and flight,  
as dreams and fears keep lifting.  
  
My peers and I, we strive to share  
a bond, a code unspoken;  
we trade approval, hopes laid bare,  
and mend what’s left unbroken.  
But parents look askance—  
they fear my steps, my stance.  
They speak, but do not hear  
the voice I wish were clear—  
my heart, in quiet token.  
  
I want to stand, yet long to lean;  
I seek, but not to sever.  
No longer child, not yet serene—  
adrift between forever.  
They name me with their pain:  
defiant, wild, insane.  
But all I want is grace—  
to find a sacred space  
where love and I may tether.  
  
So hold me still, though I may stray,  
and keep your ears wide open.  
Let silence speak what words can’t say;  
let trust remain unbroken.  
Though change may feel unkind,  
don’t leave my soul behind.  
You’ll always be my shore—  
let love, not fear, restore  
the ties we’ve never spoken.  
  
*Representative Text 2:*  
  
A child with ice cream in one hand,  
balloon held in the other,  
he ran with joy across the sand,  
his laughter with his father.  
But time has pulled us wide—  
no longer side by side.  
He speaks, but I don’t hear;  
I talk, but he’s not near.  
This change is slow and tender.  
  
“My son,” he said with steady tone,  
“you’re not a child forever.  
You must now face the world alone—  
be harsh and foolish never.”  
But still, I felt unsure:  
must I be strong and pure?  
Can I be old and young—  
both careful and high-strung—  
and keep both selves together?  
  
What once brought joy now brings me none;  
those games have lost their meaning.  
I strive to stand, to walk, to run,  
yet feel my balance leaning.  
New choices come with fear,  
and judgment’s never clear.  
One step may bring me shame,  
the next may light a flame—  
and still, the world keeps turning.  
  
My parents scold; my peers embrace—  
each claims to truly know me.  
Yet I must choose my rightful place  
while longing they’d still show me  
the love they gave before—  
unquestioned, strong, and sure.  
They say I’ve gone astray,  
but I just lost my way—  
and wish that they could know me.  
  
Not child, not grown, I walk between  
two lands with trembling spirit.  
My thoughts are caught in what has been,  
and what might soon inherit.  
I try to meet their gaze,  
but stumble through the maze.  
Their words still bind me tight,  
though I now seek the light  
of paths I shape and merit.  
  
Yet even now, I seek their hands—  
not rules, but understanding.  
Not walls, but doors with open spans,  
not scorn, but love commanding.  
So walk with me awhile,  
through every doubt and trial.  
Though I may seem apart,  
you still dwell in my heart—  
our bond, both strong and lasting.

**23\. The Plea of an Aborted Fetus** (Incipit: Set me free. Let me live, I deserve to be born, I want to live. For heaven's sake, have pity.)  
Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 8.9.8.8.9.8.6.6.4.4.4.8  
Tune: Wachet auf (Nicolai)  
  
Set me free—I sought the daylight,  
To greet the world in dawning plain sight;  
Yet silence met my infant cry.  
No kind arms to hold or name me,  
No promise of a life to claim me;  
No voice to ask the question—why?  
I stirred, a life begun,  
Too soon, too swiftly done.  
None could hear me.  
The womb grew still,  
Against my will,  
And crushed my hope, my silent will.  
  
Had I lived, I might have mattered,  
A soul not born to leave hearts shattered,  
A name among the many known.  
Dreams unmade and roots not planted,  
My future's door was never granted—  
A seed left drifting, all alone.  
The room grew cold and dim,  
My limbs grew weak and thin—  
Still I lingered.  
The world passed by;  
I asked not why,  
But wondered, was I wrong to try?  
  
I was not some mere illusion,  
No fleeting spark, no vague intrusion,  
But something full of breath and spark.  
Tiny hands, with shape and motion,  
A heart that beat in deep devotion,  
And eyes once dreaming through the dark.  
I formed with quiet grace,  
A thumbprint in my place—  
None to see me.  
A life unscrolled,  
Untold, grown cold,  
Now locked away, too small, too bold.  
  
Say my name—not to accuse you,  
But so the loss might not confuse you:  
A life unstarted still is real.  
When the world turns past my story,  
Let memory hold neither glory  
Nor guilt too vast for time to heal.  
But pause, and dare to see—  
A might-have-been was me.  
Not to shame you.  
But let it be—  
My silent plea—  
A breath once held eternally.

**24\. Am I to Be Blamed** (Incipit: They're chasing me, they're chasing, no, they must not catch me, I have enough money now...)  
Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 3.6.6.6.10.10  
Tune: Come Again (Dowland)  
  
Night draws near—  
The streets begin to hum.  
My fate, it will not come  
By law or by the spear.  
I ran to feed the ones I could not lose,  
And now they chase, with iron boots and noose.  
  
“Let me go—  
My mother waits alone.  
My crime is hunger’s groan.  
I’ve done what I must know.  
Take me, if mercy’s gone and cold remains,  
But know the truth behind these rusted chains.”  
  
I was good—  
A daughter clean and kind,  
With open heart and mind,  
Raised where the gutters stood.  
We lived with pride, though roof and bone were thin—  
Then famine pressed, and darkness entered in.  
  
Father fled—  
He vanished into smoke.  
The vows he made, he broke,  
With bitter words unsaid.  
Had I his neck, I’d squeeze until he cried—  
Would you not rage, if justice was denied?  
  
Here she lies—  
My mother, still and pale.  
No gold can now avail.  
Return the stolen prize.  
She’s gone! And so I ask you, eyes ashamed:  
For this life’s wreck, am I the one to blame?

**25\. No Pardon for Me** (Incipit: I'm sentenced. Sentenced to life in this dank cell of misery.)  
Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 8.8.7.8.8.7 (trochaic)  
  
Sentenced in this stone-bound chamber,  
Cold and cruel as dying ember,  
Life itself my only crime.  
Rules obeyed, yet judged and taken,  
By a world unjust, forsaken—  
Doomed to suffer out my time.  
  
No reprieve shall ever find me,  
Chains of fate have tightly bind me,  
Mercy’s lips are sealed and dry.  
In this court of shadowed hearing,  
Guilt was swift and truth unfearing  
Perished in a silent lie.  
  
What is death but cold illusion?  
What is life but harsh confusion?  
Hope has fled, and none remains.  
Freedom glints beyond my fingers,  
Mocking still, it haunts and lingers,  
Mockery that feeds my chains.  
  
So I wait, the poison nearing,  
Day by day the end grows clearing—  
Rest from all I’ve borne so long.  
Though the hounds may guard the border,  
And the wires wound in cruel order,  
Still I sing my silent song.

The eighty-eighth night passes,  
Summer draws her moment near;  
The hills are clothed in grasses,  
Young green leaves begin appear.  
See workers in the meadow,  
Crimson sashes flash in light,  
With hats of woven shadow—  
Peaceful, lovely sight.  
  
The skies are warm and golden,  
And the breeze is soft and kind;  
We pluck with hands emboldened,  
Steady heart and joyful mind.  
So pick—no time for slowing,  
Labor shapes the breathing land.  
The tea that's worth the growing  
Springs from human hand.

Brothers, sisters—hearts so light,  
Singing songs from morn to night.  
  
Lord, protect my home each day,  
Shield it with Thy grace, I pray.  
Send Thy angels from above,  
Guarding all I dearly love.  
  
When I grow and walk afar,  
Wander where the worldings are,  
Still my heart shall turn to Thee,  
Longing home’s pure peace to see.

**28\. Tell the World of His Love**  
Poetic adaptation of a contemporary Christian song lyrics; Meter: 8.7.8.7.D (iambic)  
  
For God so loved this fallen world,  
He gave His Son to save it.  
In Christ, His precious gift was hurled  
At sin, and none can brave it.  
He sends us forth, His word to share,  
With hearts made bold and burning,  
To speak His love both far and near,  
All lost ones homeward turning.  
  
The Lord is King, our Prince of Peace,  
The Son of God eternal.  
He came that bondage might now cease—  
Our hope, our life supernal.  
Let earth and heaven sing His praise,  
His justice ever glorious,  
Till all shall walk in all His ways,  
And rise in grace victorious.  
  
Go tell the world of love divine—  
The greatest ever spoken!  
Seek those who stray from mercy’s line,  
Their hearts by grief now broken.  
Let Christ’s own light in darkness blaze,  
His truth to all revealing;  
And walk with Him through all your days,  
His boundless love unsealing.

Poetic adaptation of a declamation piece; Meter: 14.14.4.7.8 (dactylic)  
Tune: Lobe den Herren (Stralsund Gesangbuch, 1665)  
  
*Representative Text 1:*  
  
Midnight is falling, the hunger inside me is burning.  
Three days of running, with fear in my chest ever turning.  
Nowhere to stay—  
They are still hunting their prey,  
And there’s no hope of returning.  
  
Governor’s mansion is cold in its silence and power;  
He’ll see me jailed by the end of this very same hour.  
Who did I kill?  
Say it again, if you will—  
Justice was mine in that hour.  
  
Back in the library, lost in a book’s quiet wonder,  
Time slipped away like a storm that is silent with thunder.  
Alone I stayed—  
There in the twilight and shade,  
Never expecting the plunder.  
  
There he was waiting, with roses and lies and possession.  
Soft words like knives, dressed in pink-scented letters’ confession.  
“Let me drive you.”  
“Brenda, I’d give all for you.”  
Twisted with cruel obsession.  
  
“Love” was his weapon, and “No” was a threat to his power.  
“No” made him darken and strike like a storm in its hour.  
Laughter was death—  
Mocking and stealing my breath,  
Kissing with violence and power.  
  
Pain in my stomach, and rust on a blade I was clutching,  
Terror and fire in my limbs, all my soul forward rushing.  
“Touch me again—  
Hell will be all that you win!”  
I was a thunderstorm crushing.  
  
Now I am running through midnight, through guilt and through grieving.  
Blood on my hands, and the echo of death never leaving.  
I did not choose—  
But in that moment, I lose.  
Still, I am not unbelieving.  
  
*Representative Text 2:*  
  
Midnight has fallen; my breath comes in fevered convulsion.  
Three days of fleeing have drained me in restless compulsion.  
Where can I hide?  
Hunted, no place to abide—  
Terror consumes my propulsion.  
  
Leo’s own father commands with a governor’s power;  
Nothing can shield me if caught in this desperate hour.  
Don’t call me vile!  
Listen, just wait for a while—  
Truth has its moment to flower.  
  
Deep in the library’s hush I had lost all sensation,  
Drawn by a novel, alone past the hour of cessation.  
Then came his voice—  
Softly disguised as a choice,  
Masked with a dark adoration.  
  
Fragrant with letters and gifts I could never receive him,  
Still he would follow, refuse every sign I would leave him.  
“Love me,” he said,  
“Do as I say—or be dead.”  
Power like his—I believed him.  
  
“Leo,” I cried, “You’re a ghost I refuse to remember!  
You are no lover, no light, only ash and cold ember!”  
Still he drew near,  
Smiling with threat and with leer—  
Then came the fall and the tremor.  
  
Slammed to the wall, and he laughed as he tore at my pleading,  
Struck me and loomed like a god, on my body now feeding.  
Nobody heard.  
Only the silence had stirred—  
Till I struck back through the bleeding.  
  
Rust on the blade, and the blood on my hands was unspoken.  
Screaming, I stabbed, till the spell of his grip had been broken.  
I did not plan—  
Only escaped from a man.  
Now I am hunted, and broken.

Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
I can't go outside.  
All my games are softly calling,  
But I must abide.  
Even my red sash is stalling—  
Torn and cast aside.  
  
Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Still we can make cheer.  
Let us fold our paper, stalling  
Every gloomy tear.  
Shapes and cranes and flowers sprawling,  
Bright and full of cheer.  
  
Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Pheasant calls alone.  
In the dusk its cry is calling  
From a world unknown.  
It must feel the cold enthralling—  
Chilled down to the bone.  
  
Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Still it will not cease.  
Though my doll lies gently sprawling,  
Waiting there in peace,  
All my little sparklers, stalling—  
Flicker then release.  
  
Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Day and night the same.  
Clouds above are softly calling,  
Whisp’ring like a name.  
Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Never tired of rain.

Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Can’t go out today.

Wistful dreams at play.  
Even my red sandals, stalling—  
Broken in the fray.  
  
Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Let’s not sit and sigh.  
We can fold some paper, stalling  
Time as hours fly.  
Cranes and fans and towers sprawling—  
Watch them reach the sky.  
  
Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Hear the pheasant cry.  
From the field its voice is calling,  
Lonely 'neath the sky.  
It must feel the cold wind crawling,  
Wishing it were dry.  
  
Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Still it will not end.  
Though my doll lies gently sprawling,  
Quiet as a friend,  
Even all my sparklers, brawling—  
Burned down to the end.  
  
Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Day and night the same.  
Clouds drift low, the wind is drawling,  
Whispers soft as flame.  
Rain is falling, rain is falling,  
Calling out my name.

*Representative Text 1:*  
  
When You spoke, our hearts were burning,  
Words that made the darkness flee.  
In our souls, Your truth discerning,  
Eyes were opened now to see:  
Bread once broken—  
There You gave Yourself for me.  
  
Like a dawn, Your light came shining,  
Hope returned where night had reigned.  
Hearts were stirred, in love inclining,  
By Your mercy unrestrained.  
Glory rising—  
In Your wounds our joy is gained.  
  
Flesh once pierced now lives forever,  
By the Spirit’s quickening breath.  
You, our Lord, forsaken never,  
Chose the garden, grief, and death.  
Blood was falling—  
Poured to save from sin and wrath.  
  
Laid as wine and bread before us,  
You became our strength, our song.  
When we feast, we know You’re for us,  
Christ within our hearts made strong.  
Hope of glory—  
To Your risen life we long.

Breaking hearts once bound in stone;

Light You gave, and hope ignited,  
Love that drew our hearts above;  
Wounded souls, by grace invited,  
Found in You the flame of love.  
Hope eternal—  
Draws us to Your heart thereof.  
  
By Your flesh and Spirit given,  
You have poured abundant grace;  
Blood like rain from earth to heaven  
Fell to cleanse our fallen race.  
Holy Savior,  
Died to take the sinner’s place.  
  
Bread and wine, Your life declaring,

Light you brought to hearts once grieving,  
Flame of hope You did restore;  
In our souls, Your love is cleaving,

We shall praise forevermore.  
  
Flesh once torn now reigns eternal,

Blood that caused the world to thrive.

Light has pierced our darkest sorrow,  
You have kindled hope anew;  
From Your grace, our hearts now borrow  
Longings for a love so true.  
Christ our treasure,  
Glory's dawn comes into view.  
  
By Your flesh, once bruised and broken,  
Life flows forth through Spirit's breath;  
Every tear and word You've spoken  
Seals our ransom, conquers death.  
In the garden,  
Blood was poured with sacred depth.  
  
Bread and wine reveal Your dying,  
Living hope in simple sign;  
Hearts, once weak, now lifted, flying—  
By Your grace we are made Thine.  
Christ within us,  
Hope and glory intertwined.

O Lord, we lift our song,

You shape our steps each day.  
  
So now with love we give  
Our hearts and voices too;

**33\. Prayer for Generosity** (Attributed to St. Ignatius of Loyola)  
Poetic adaptation of a prayer; Meter: 4.4.6.4.4.6 (dactylic)  
  
O Lord above,  
In boundless love,  
Please teach my heart to give;  
Not counting cost,  
Nor fearing loss,  
But serving while I live.  
  
When battle calls,  
Though weakness falls,  
Still help me stand and fight;  
Through wounds and pain,  
No thought of gain,  
But striving for the right.  
  
Though labor's load  
Be rough the road,  
Let me not seek for rest;  
Nor seek reward,  
But serve you, Lord,  
And know Your will is best.  
  
So let me be,  
In heart and knee,  
Obedient to Your call;  
To love, to give,  
In You to live—  
My God, my all in all.

Take, O my Lord, my life, my liberty,  
All that I am, my soul and memory;  
Take my whole mind, my heart, my steadfast will,  
Use them, O God, to serve Your perfect will.  
  
Give but Your grace, Your love, and I am blessed,  
Richer than kings, with nothing else possessed;  
All I have gained, I offer now to You,  
Freely to give, as You gave all things too.

**35\. One More Gift** (Manuel V. Francisco, SJ)  
Poetic adaptation of a contemporary Christian song lyrics; Meter: CM (8.6.8.6; iambic)  
  
*Representative Text 1:*  
  
If one more gift I sought from Thee,  
O Lord, my heart would pray,  
“Grant peace upon this earth to be,  
as children laugh and play.”  
  
Thy people walk in wearied strife,  
confused in mind and soul;  
when will we learn that heav’nly life  
is peace that makes us whole?  
  
No realm above can rest secure  
while we in discord dwell;  
but love’s own work will still endure,  
and broken hearts make well.  
  
So, Lord, give calm within my breast,  
where hidden storms may be;  
for all without will find their rest  
when peace abides in me.  
  
*Representative Text 2:*  
  
If one more gift I asked from You,  
my prayer would simply be:  
“Bring peace on earth, so pure and true,  
as children’s laughter free.”  
  
Your people live in weary strife,  
confused in heart and mind;  
when will we learn that peaceful life  
is what You’ve long designed?  
  
No heaven rests in perfect light  
while we in discord stay;  
yet love still works to make things right  
and heal our hearts today.  
  
So, Lord, bring calm within my soul  
where storms can rage unseen;  
for peace will flow and make us whole  
when it begins within.

I’ll sing forever of Your love,  
O Lord, my heart’s delight;  
Your wondrous name I’ll lift above,  
Your mercies ever bright.  
Your word declares forgiving grace,  
Your gentle love’s release;  
It shines with light from Your dear face  
And speaks of mercy, peace.  
  
At dawn we wake to know Your care,  
Your steadfast love we sing;  
Through all our days Your praise we share,  
Our hearts as gifts we bring.  
Your love extends beyond the sky,  
Your truth will never cease;  
As sure as morning meets the eye,  
Your faith is crowned with peace.  
  
I’ll sing forever, Lord most high,  
My refuge and my stay;  
To You in need my soul will fly,  
Through night and brightest day.  
Your Spirit fills the earth with light,  
Your word makes sorrows cease;  
It turns our grief to pure delight  
And grants Your mercy, peace.

To Christ our King.  
He is our life and way,  
Rising bright in endless day;  
He reigns in heav’n’s array  
This Easter morn.

The life, the truth, the way.

The Lord who conquered death;  
With joy I have embraced Him  
And shared His holy breath.  
I’ll tell the world His glory,  
Until the earth is stirred,

Can part His love from me.  
His might and mercy near me,  
His word my constant stay;  
His presence still shall cheer me  
Through night as well as day.

And touched His wounded side;  
To all the earth’s far prison  
His royal name I’ll guide.  
With joy His praise confessing,  
I tell His wondrous fame,  
That all may know His blessing  
And trust His holy Name.  
  
Before His throne all nations  
Shall bend the willing knee;  
His truth and just foundations  
Shall stand eternally.

To Him in earth and heaven  
Let endless glory ring!

In Him alone is all our hope,

Our strength, our life, our peace is He,

What gift endures that we have made?  
The world cannot our hearts fulfill,  
Its empty joys but mock us still.  
  
O cease your chase of fleeting breath,  
The hollow paths that lead to death;  
Let Christ His boundless love impart,  
And pour His fullness in your heart.  
  
In Him alone we stand and live,  
Our souls to Him we gladly give;  
He saves, He heals, His mercy true,  
His love shall all our days renew.

Lord, receive the gifts we gladly bear;  
earth’s own bounty, fruit of toil and care.  
Take and bless the work our hands have done,  
make it holy through Your saving Son.  
  
Sun and moon and wind and rain combine,  
all creation gathered in the vine.  
Dreams and labors, hopes of humankind,  
all we offer now as bread and wine.  
  
By Your Spirit, change these gifts, O Lord,  
into Jesus, living bread outpoured.  
Blessed and broken, given in His name,  
hearts are healed and hungers not the same.

Through this banquet, sanctified we live,  
love unending, Lord, to You we give.

Human toil and dreams together meet,  
lifted up to You in off’ring sweet.  
  
Bread and wine, O Lord, we set apart;  
change them by Your Spirit’s wondrous art.  
Broken, shared, they feed the world in need,  
grace of heaven answering each plead.  
  
Here we taste the feast that has no end,  
here the lowly find the Lord their friend.  
He who sanctifies the gifts we raise  
draws the world to Him in endless praise.

O wondrous gift, beyond what words can show,  
That You are with us everywhere we go.

And long that all may know Your love worldwide;  
The cross has sealed the hope by which we live,  
The streams of grace Your wounded side still give.  
  
O Master, lead us gently day by day,  
Transform our hearts, remove our pride away;  
Turn all the wolves within to meek and mild,  
And teach us how to love as You have smiled.  
  
For all we need, O Christ, in You is found,  
Your gift of life makes every joy abound;  
Be here with us, our treasure and our rest,  
Our Lord, our All, in You we still are blessed.

Where there dwells a fear,  
gentle hands may still the tide,  
where the wounds appear,  
balm of mercy will abide,  
healing flows and will not hide.  
  
Where there rages hate,  
chains shall fall, the captives rise,  
I will guard the gate,  
peace shall calm the stormy skies,  
love shall answer every cry.  
  
Grant me courage, Lord,  
grant me strength to walk Your way,  
grant me heart restored,  
that with mercy I obey,  
that I be Your heart today.  
  
When the shadows spread,  
and the broken world I see,  
draw me from the dead,  
free my heart and set it free,  
that Your light may shine through me.  
  
When my labor’s done,  
yet the hearts unmoved remain,  
still, O Lord, I run,  
give me hope through loss and pain,  
that Your heart may live again.  
  
*Representative Text 2:*  
  
Where the fears abide,  
I will quiet hearts that weep.  
Where the wounds divide,

Give the hungry souls to keep.  
  
Where the hatreds stay,  
Chains shall fall and captives go.  
Anger fades away,  
Peace shall like a river flow,  
Christ has made His mercy show.  
  
Lord, Your courage give,  
Strength and love to walk Your way.  
Teach me how to live,  
Grant me heart and voice to pray,  
That I may be Yours today.  
  
When the night is near,  
And the world is torn apart,  
Drive away my fear;  
Bid me rise with steadfast heart,  
Love Your people, take my part.  
  
When my work is done,  
Still the hardened hearts resist.  
Hope shall yet be won;  
Let me walk through sorrow’s mist,  
Be Your heart that will persist.

Singable translation; Meter: 8.5.8.5  

*Representative Text 1:*  

Evening glows with embers dying,  
Red-winged dragonfly,  
On my back I watched you flying—  
When was that, and why?  

On the hill the mulberries darken,  
Sweet with summer’s air;  
Did I dream I saw and harkened,  
Plucking berries there?  

At fifteen my sister, sighing,  
Wed and went away;  
From her home no word replying  
Comes to me today.  

Evening glows with embers dying,  
Red-winged dragonfly;  
On the pole you rest, defying  
Time that drifts on by.  

*Representative Text 2:*  

Crimson skies in sunset’s glowing,  
Dragonfly of red,  
On my back I watched you going—  
Days long vanished, fled.  
  
Mulberries from mountain meadows,  
Dreams of days gone by,  
In my little basket’s shadows—  
Was it truth or lie?  
  
Fifteen years—my nurse departed,  
Wed and gone away,  
From her home no word has started  
Since that distant day.  
  
Crimson skies in sunset’s glowing,  
Dragonfly of red,  
On the pole’s thin tip you’re showing,  
Still and overhead.
